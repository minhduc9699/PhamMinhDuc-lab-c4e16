 and we can break the program into sub-steps, make it easier to understand

Q:What is return, why and how do we use it?
A:
- 'return' is a statement to take the result of function
and return to the caller as the “fruit” of calling this function
- We use 'return' because we want to use the result of function for next steps
- To use the function with 'return', we assign the results returned to variables

Q:Do we have to use return in every function?
A:No, we don't.

Q:What are function arguments/parameters, why and how we use it?
A:
- argument: A value provided to a function when the function is called. This value is assigned
to the corresponding parameter in the function. The argument can be the result of an
expression which may involve operators, operands and calls to other fruitful functions.
- parameter: A name used inside a function to refer to the value which was passed to it as an
argument

- we use parameters to pass input value for function

Q:How to use function from a different file other than our currently working file?
A:Use 'import' statetment
